    <center><h1>F.A.Q.</h1></center>

    <h3>"Will Calorie Counter affect individuals differently if they have genetic disorders?"</h3>
    <p>Yes, if the user has diabetes, Celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or other diseases that require irregular calorie intakes, 
    then the user should contact their Physician before attempting to consume our recommended number of calories.</p>
    
    <h3>"How does Calorie Counter work exactly?"</h3>
    <p>Calorie Counter Calculates the users BMI (Body Mass Index), then based off how much their BMI deviates from the average BMI standard,
    Calorie Counter then predicts the users body type status (normal, overweight, underweight).
    Then from this information, calorie counter will recommend the number of calories based on their body Status. NormalCalorieIntake+-500 will determine weight loss/gain.
    For example, if the user is overweight, then we will recommend their NormalCalorieLimit -500. Therefore they will lose a pound a week.
    If their body status determines underweight, then recommendation is NormalCalorieLimit+500, so they will gain a pound a week.
     Lastly, normal body weight will result in NormalCalorieLimit, which will cause the user to remain the same weight.</p>
    
    <h3>"Is Calorie Counter gender specific?"</h3>
    <p>Yes, Calorie Counter is gender specific-hence why we ask for your gender input.
    BMI (Body Mass Index) has a different average for males and females.</p>
    
    <h3>"What's the point of the Calorie Counter Graph feature?"</h3>
    <p>The Calorie Counter graph feature is a user friendly feature that
     allows the user to track their progress of weight gain,weight loss, or weight consistency. 
     It provides a basis that allows users to realize the impact that the calorieIntake has made on their weight (pounds) with respect to time (months).</p>
